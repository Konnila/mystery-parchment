# parchment

A coding challenge. If you know you know :).

Huge shout-out to @mikera and his https://github.com/mikera/imagez library. Never used it before, but seemed to work very well :).

## Usage

In project root, with just java installed you can run this uberjar with

    $ java -jar parchment-0.1.0-standalone.jar

If you have clojure + leininger installed, in root folder you can also do

    $ lein run
